// MARK: - ProtocolRowView (#457)
//
// #457: the per-protocol row, cut out of `ServersView.carrierRowView` +
// `carrierRowLead`. ServersView has hit the Swift type-checker's expression
// budget twice (see `ServersView.carrierModals`), so everything this screen
// gains from here on lands in a small, value-driven struct like this one: every
// input is a plain value or a closure, and every parameter is explicitly typed,
// so the row costs the type-checker nothing to resolve.
//
// This is the densest element in the app — one row has to answer "what is this
// protocol, does it work, and how do I know". #460: "one row", not "one
// line" — the labels column is ~105pt wide once the evidence chip and the
// fixed 44pt menu have taken theirs, so each answer gets a line of its own
// rather than a share of one. The two inversions it fixes:
//
//  • SEMANTIC — nothing here is carried by colour alone. The evidence chip
//    renders glyph + word + age; the row adds the WORD "Live" for the protocol
//    the tunnel is running through (#460 was: "Connected", which was long
//    enough to be hyphenated into "Connec-ted"; #471 was: that word on a line
//    of its own with a bolt glyph — it leads the subtitle now), and a plain
//    sentence when the server-side process is not running.
//    #457 was: a cyan `checkmark.circle.fill` whose only text was an
//    `accessibilityLabel`, i.e. "live" was a colour to everyone who could see it.
//
//  • DECORATION — #455's aurora WASH, its cyan hairline and the cyan checkmark
//    are gone (`Theme.Palette.auroraSoft` is deleted). The aurora survives as
//    exactly ONE thing: a 3pt leading spine, and only where it is a VERDICT —
//    the row is live AND a probe verified it inside the freshness window.
//
// boc #471: ONE protocol row for both tabs. A protocol was drawn by two
// unrelated components — `ConnectionRowView` on Connect (its own card, a
// rounded body-step title, a caption subtitle) and this one on Servers (an
// inset plate at radius 12 inside a radius-20 card, a `.subheadline` title —
// the only non-rounded title in the app — and a caption2 subtitle). Same
// object, two dialects, so the model has to be learned twice.
// Three deletions align them, and nothing is added:
//   • the plate and its `rowShape` — the card is already a container, and a
//     container inside a container at a smaller radius is not concentric.
//     Rows separate with a hairline in `ServerCardView.protocolsSection`;
//   • the "⚡ Live" LINE — the word leads `subtitleText` instead, so a row is
//     at most two lines: `[Live] · transport · [not running]`;
//   • the `primary` tag and its `isPrimary` input — which container anchors
//     the deploy dir is an internal concept the design plan's cut list
//     retires, and it was the one token on the row with no user meaning.
// eoc #471

    /// while the call site has always passed `transportLabel(_:)`.
    let transport: String
    // #471 was: `let isPrimary: Bool` — "the srv.sh-installed protocol, the one
    // whose container anchors the deploy dir". True, internal, and of no use to
    // anyone reading the row; it printed a `primary` tag in the subtitle.

    // boc #460: finding 16 — the live row hyphenated its own status word
    // ("Connec-ted"). The row is three channels wide — labels, evidence chip
    // and the overflow menu — and the menu costs a FIXED 44pt at every text size, so
    // on a 393pt phone the labels column is left with roughly 105pt. A carrier
    // name and a status word never fitted in that together, and SwiftUI resolves
    // an impossible line by breaking the last word in it.
    //
    // Three changes, each removing one cause:
    //   1. the badge has its OWN line (see `labels`), so it never competes with
    //      the carrier name for width;
    //   2. it is `lineLimit(1)` + `fixedSize`, which makes a break impossible at
    //      any width it is ever offered — the chip beside it is the flexible one
    //      and is documented to wrap instead (App/UI/HealthChip.swift);
    //   3. the word itself is shorter (`protocolLiveBadge`), because the old one
    //      was the longest string in the row in both languages.
    // #471 was: "The `primary` tag left the title line for the same reason and
    // now joins the technical subtitle" — the tag is deleted outright. What is
    // left in the subtitle still wraps freely and still breaks only at a " · "
    // between words, never inside one.

            // With no plate there is nothing for a trailing inset to sit inside
