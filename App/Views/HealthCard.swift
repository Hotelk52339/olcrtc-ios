// MARK: - DiagnosticsCard (#454 / #258, merged #459)
//
// FILE NOTE (#459): this file is still called HealthCard.swift because renaming
// it needs an `xcodegen generate` pass, which cannot run on this machine. Its
// contents are the Diagnostics card; rename the file to DiagnosticsCard.swift on
// the next regeneration (`sources: - path: App` is a directory glob, so no
// project.yml edit is involved).
//
// #459: ONE card, because there were two and they said the same things.
//
// #459 was: `HealthCard` ("Connection health": protocol / exit / latency /
// throughput, only while a session was up) sat directly above `Diagnostics` (IP
// check / speed test / carrier endpoints) — and the two overlapped on the two
// facts the user actually reads. Latency was measured twice: a live 8 s probe in
// the health card and a `SpeedResult.pingMs` figure in the speed row, which
// carried no timestamp at all and could be inherited from a previous session or
// a DIRECT-mode run. Two cards, two ping numbers, one screen. The owner's
// verdict — "maybe KEEP Diagnostics and REMOVE Health, everything should be
// logical" — is exactly right, so Diagnostics is the name that survives and the
// health card's four facts move in as its first block.
//
// The card is two blocks:
//   A. "This session" — what is true about the tunnel that is up RIGHT NOW.
//      Mounted only while connected. Protocol (the ONE place this screen states
//      the carrier/transport), exit, live response time.
//   B. "Checks" — the two things the user can RUN: IP check and speed test.
//      Always present, because they are the only entry points to
//      `IPChecker.checkAll` and `SpeedTest.run`. #461 was: a third row for the
//      #328 carrier exclusions, now an item in the connected record's menu.
//
// #461: block A's third fact is called "Latency" again, because there is only
// one latency in the app now. #460 had renamed it "Response time" and added a
// paragraph explaining why it read ~8x the per-connection chips: this card timed
// a whole request INCLUDING opening the connection, the chips timed a round-trip
// on a connection already open. `LatencyProbe` (SpeedTest.swift) collapses the
// two methods into one, and `publishLiveLatency` makes the live node's chip
// print this card's own sample. The explanation is deleted with the discrepancy
// it explained. Full reasoning on `responseRow`.
//
// #460: every fact in block A now also says WHERE IT COMES FROM, not just when
// it was taken. Dating a claim answers "is this still true?"; sourcing it
// answers "who says so?" — the owner asked the second question out loud about
// the exit country, and it applies to every number here. Block B's third row
// gained the same treatment for a different reason (finding 23): it named a
// mechanism nobody outside the project recognises, so it now names the
// SITUATION it applies to instead.
//
// NOTHING IS DRAWN THAT CANNOT BE DATED (#457, kept verbatim). Every value
// carries the age of the measurement behind it, in the same `HealthAge`
// vocabulary the row verdicts use, so a number from four minutes ago can never
// read as "now".
//
// #457's "measuring… forever" fix is kept too: `SpeedTest.quickPing` returns nil
// on ANY error, so the state machine is explicit — `probing` (a measurement is
// in flight now) vs `latencyAt` (when one last completed). "Checking…" is
// reachable only while `probing` is true AND nothing has completed yet.
//
// Throughput stays deliberately hard to claim: `SpeedResult` carries no
// timestamp, so a `lastResult` inherited from an earlier session — or from a
// DIRECT-mode test — is not evidence about the tunnel that is up now. The speed
// row dates only a run this view watched finish.
//
// #459 was also: `HealthCard.refreshButton` (an `arrow.clockwise` glyph). The
// list now pulls to refresh, screen-wide; a per-card refresh glyph beside a
// screen-wide gesture is two controls for one job.
//
// #471: THE CARD STOPS EXPLAINING ITSELF. Three things went, and each was a
// second copy of something still on screen: the Protocol row (the hero names the
// carrier and the transport), the exit row's `note:` paragraph (its one clause
// now rides the age line) and the permanent IP-source hint (the Run button's
// accessibility hint). The exit VALUE is the IP alone — the place belongs to the
// hero, which prints it with a flag one card up. Both block headers draw
// `OlcSectionHeader`, the design system's one section-header treatment, instead
// of a local look-alike.
//
// It stays SEPARATE view structs (not inlined into ConnectionsView.body) so that
// file's already-large body stays under the SwiftUI type-checker budget, and so
// each `body` here is under ~25 lines.
