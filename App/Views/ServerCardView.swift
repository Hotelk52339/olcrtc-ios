// MARK: - ServerCardView (#457)
//
// #457: one VPS card, cut out of `ServersView` (`hostCard` / `hostCardTop` /
// `hostCardBottom` / `statusRegion` / `processCaption` / `metricsStrip` /
// `actionBar` / `primaryButton` / `protocolsSection` / `healthSweepFooter`).
// ServersView has hit the Swift type-checker's expression budget twice, so the
// card is a small value-driven struct: every input is a plain value or a
// closure, explicitly typed, and every sub-view here stays under ~20 lines.
//
// Reading order on the card is the order of the questions the owner asks:
//   1 which server is this        → header (+ the machine, as ONE caption)
//   2 what is true right now      → the status pill, and nothing else
//   3 what runs on it, does it work → PROTOCOLS (the content)
//   4 what do I do next           → ONE full-width action
//   5 what else can I do to it    → "Logs" / "Manage ›", one row of links
//
// boc #471: five answers, not six — and each of them stated ONCE. The card used
// to say its one claim three times (pill → `readStamp` → `failureBanner`), its
// one age three times (pill subtitle, read stamp, each row's chip) and a
// millisecond value twice in two different units (the health chip's end-to-end
// latency, and PING — a TCP-22 round-trip — in the metrics grid beside it).
// What left the card in this pass, and where each fact went:
//   • `readStamp` → `HostHeadline.reduce` dates the claim it qualifies;
//   • `failureBanner` → the same headline's tally ("2 of 2 protocols
//     verified 2 min ago"), so "Working" and "not working" never share a card;
//   • `ServerMetricsGrid` → one tertiary caption under the address
//     (disk / RAM / uptime) plus read-only rows on the Manage screen;
//   • PING → the Manage screen only. The pill's `.unreachable` state already
//     says whether the host answers, and a TCP-22 round-trip is not a user
//     fact — it only ever contradicted the verified latency on the row below;
//   • `quickRow` → a text link beside "Manage ›", so the card ends on ONE
//     filled button instead of three action treatments.
// eoc #471
//
// boc #459: the card grows into the empty half of the Servers screen instead of
// something new being invented to fill it — 20pt between blocks, roomier
// protocol rows, and the affordances the owner reached for most often (Container
// logs, the primary verb, and the way to everything else) visible on the card
// rather than buried in a 13-item ⋯ menu.
// #461 was: "the four affordances", Check server among them — it duplicated
// pull-to-refresh, so it is gone (ServersView.quickActions).
// #471 was: "roomier protocol rows" meant each row drew its own plate; and the
// last of the promoted affordances (Container logs) was still a full-width
// button. Rows separate with a hairline now and the verb is a link.
// What LEFT the card in the same pass:
//   • the process caption ("Server process is running · read 2m ago") — it
//     restated the status pill and each protocol row already says whether its
//     own container is up. Only its AGE was load-bearing, so the age survives
//     as the read stamp — on the metrics block then, under the status pill
//     since #461, and nothing else of it does.
//   • the sweep note ("N more not checked — tap Verify all") — a footnote
//     advertising a button that pull-to-refresh replaces. Every skipped
//     protocol still says "not checked" in its own chip, which is the same
//     fact stated per item instead of in aggregate.
// eoc #459
//
// #457 was: four unlabelled 44pt icon buttons (antenna / arrow.down.doc /
// slider.horizontal.3 / RobotIcon) squeezing the primary action into a fifth of
// the row. Every one of them duplicated an item that is already in the overflow
// menu, so deleting them costs nothing and buys the primary action its width.

/// #457: the primary action a card is allowed to offer. The rule the old
/// `primaryButton` broke: never offer an action no evidence justifies. A server
/// nothing has ever read (`HostBase.unknown`) gets **Check server**, never
/// Install — `scripts/srv.sh` force-removes every `olcrtc-server-*` container,
/// so one tap on a re-added VPS used to destroy a working deployment.
