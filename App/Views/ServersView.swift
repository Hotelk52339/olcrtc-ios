// MARK: - ServersView
//
// #457: the SECOND of three tabs (Connect · Servers · Settings). Manages SSH
// credentials for the servers where we can install / uninstall olcrtc, plus
// triggers those operations from the device.
// #457 was: "Third tab" — it was the third of five before Config and Logs
// stopped being tabs.
//
// #258: SINGLE-SOURCE display model (replaces the old dual-source
// `statusIconInfo`, which read `provisioner.status` + per-host `readiness`
// together and wrote optimistic base states mid-flight — the cause of the
// "status jumps"). A host now shows exactly ONE of:
//   • .base(HostBase)            — what the server IS; set ONLY by a confirmed probe
//   • .running(op, phase, note)  — what we're DOING; steady amber, phases advance
//                                  forward only, never touches base state
//   • .failed(op, phase, msg)    — an op threw; shown over the last base, with Retry
// The dot stays amber for the whole operation and changes colour exactly once,
// at the terminal probe result (`.animation(.easeInOut, value: display)`).
//
// Status / phase strings here are hardcoded English to match this file's existing
// convention (the old statusIconInfo did the same); menu/action labels reuse the
// existing L10n cases. Promoting these to L10n is a separate cleanup.

    // A Yandex Telemost link stops working 24 hours after it is created
    // («ссылка на созвон работает 24 часа»), and a server parked in the room
    // does not extend it. The manual cure — open telemost.yandex.ru, create a
    // conference, copy the id, deliver it to the VPS over SSH — needs exactly
    // the channel a whitelist window blocks. This is the same errand as one
    // press, and it runs on the PHONE for a structural reason: if the VPS
    // rotated its own room, the phone could never learn the new id, because the
    // only channel to it during a whitelist window is the tunnel that just died
    // with the old room.
    //
    // Nothing about DELIVERING a room is reinvented here. `renewTelemostRoom`
    // creates the room and then hands it to `reconfigure(_:containerName:recordID:options:)`

    // restarts that ONE container, rebuilds the ConnectionRecord from the URI
