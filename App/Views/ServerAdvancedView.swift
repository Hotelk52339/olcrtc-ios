// MARK: - ServerAdvancedView (#459)
//
// #459: "Manage server" — the pushed destination behind the one low-emphasis row
// at the foot of a VPS card. It exists because the card's ⋯ menu had grown to
// THIRTEEN items, six of them destructive, and the owner had to open it for
// almost everything: "to do anything I have to go into those tiny three dots
// where SO MUCH is shown".
//
// The split is by frequency, not by danger alone:
//   • constantly       → the card's two text links (Logs, Manage ›)
//                        (#471 was: "visible buttons on the card (Check
//                        server, Container logs)" — both are gone as buttons)
//   • the next step    → the card's ONE primary button (Start / Stop / Install…)
//   • occasionally     → the card's ⋯ menu, now 5 safe items
//   • rarely / destructive → here
//
// A `Form` is the whole point of pushing rather than menu-ing. A `Menu` cannot
// render a footer, which is why "Wipe all olcrtc data from server" used to sit
// in a scrolling list with nothing but its own name to warn you. Every
// destructive row here carries a sentence saying what it destroys, and each one
// still ends in the SAME `.confirmationDialog` it always did (owned by
// ServersView.hostConfirmations) — so a destructive verb is now behind two
// deliberate steps, a push and a confirm, instead of one menu tap.
//
// Plain values and closures only — no stores, no `@ObservedObject` — the same
// rule `ServerCardView` and `ProtocolRowView` follow, so this screen costs the
// type-checker nothing. (ServersView has hit its expression budget three times.)

/// one that answers "does it work". Pre-formatted by ServersView, whose
/// `shortUsage` / `shortRAM` / `shortUptime` statics stay there because
