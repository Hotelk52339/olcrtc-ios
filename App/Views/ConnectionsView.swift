// MARK: - ConnectionsView — the Connect tab (#457, restructured #459)
//
// JOB: state the truth about the tunnel right now, and offer the ONE action that
// changes it. Nothing is drawn that cannot be dated.
//
// Top to bottom:
//   1. ConnectHero          — the state as the largest text on the screen, WHICH
//                             SERVICE the traffic hides inside (#461), one line
//                             of dated evidence, the scope, one labelled button,
//                             and that connection's action menu.
//   2. Switch protocol      — one row per OTHER connection: carrier · transport,
//                             the host label under it, and one `OlcHealthChip`.
//                             TAP = connect.
//   3. Auto-switch          — #460: the failover switch, moved off the Settings
//                             tab to sit with the protocols it switches between;
//                             #461: now BELOW the list it governs.
//   4. Diagnostics          — "This session" (protocol / exit / latency, only
//                             while connected) + "Checks" (IP check, speed
//                             test). See HealthCard.swift.
//
// #461: THAT ORDER IS THE CHANGE. Readouts may not stand between the user and
// the switcher — see `connectionList` for the rule and where it comes from.
//
// #459: THE ONE STRUCTURAL DECISION — the hero's subject is NOT in the list.
// `heroSubjectID` (the live node while a session is up, else `store.primary`) is
// skipped when the rows are drawn, so a connection's name appears exactly once
// on this screen. That answers both halves of the owner's complaint: the
// duplication between the hero and the rows is gone BY CONSTRUCTION, and "which
// one is selected?" is answered by POSITION and CONTAINER — the selected node is
// the big card at the top, the one with the button in it. That is the only
// selection marker; no accent bar, no badge, no new vocabulary. (The existing
// `auroraVerdictRing` is a VERDICT mark, not a selection mark.)
//
// The filtering happens at RENDER time, not in `recompute()`: keeping `groups`
// whole means `groupHeader`'s failing count and `groupFooter`'s subscription
// metadata still describe the real group, and a group whose only member is the
// hero's subject renders as an empty `Section` rather than silently dropping its
// quota footer.
//
// #461 was: "#459: DIAGNOSTICS MOVED ABOVE THE LIST … so the switcher goes
// last." That order is inverted now — the switcher is second and Diagnostics is
// LAST, below the auto-switch card. See `connectionList` for the rule that put
// it there. (#457's note about a future pushed "Check & why" screen stays
// retired: Diagnostics is the ONE card, having absorbed the old `HealthCard`.)
//
// #459: PULL TO REFRESH replaces the per-group "Verify all" button. See
// `refreshEverything()`.
//
// #457 (structure) was: hero → diagnostics → servers, with `.navigationTitle("OlcRTC")`
// above it all. A 34 pt brand name carrying no information sat over a 15 pt
// status pill, and three always-rendered buttons that show nothing until pressed
// held the second-best position on the app's most-used screen. The brand name is
// gone (inline title), the answer is the largest thing here, and diagnostics sit
// under the content they are about.
//
// #457 (surgery discipline): this file had already hit the SwiftUI type-checker's
// expression budget twice. Every change is by EXTRACTION — the hero lives in
// ConnectHero.swift, the row in ConnectionRowView.swift, the diagnostics card in
// HealthCard.swift, and the List's modifiers are split across two small wrapper
// functions. Nothing here has a `body` over ~20 lines or a chain over ~8.
//
// #456: the row verdicts are `HealthCoordinator`'s persisted, timestamped
// evidence. Green means an HTTP 2xx came back through that node's OWN SOCKS
// listener, minutes ago — not "we ran something once".
