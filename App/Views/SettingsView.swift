// MARK: - SettingsView
//
// #457: the THIRD and last tab, ordered by consequence. Surfaces values that
// used to be hardcoded, plus the two sections the deleted Config tab held.
//
// #460 (screenshot findings 10, 11, 13, 20, 21): regrouped BY SUBJECT, and
// every explanation now sits with the control it explains. A `Form` footer
// belongs to its whole SECTION, so an explanation written for one control kept
// rendering under an unrelated row four positions down; the fix, applied
// everywhere, is a note row (`TunnelSettingsNote`) directly under its control,
// and a footer only where it explains the whole section.
//
// #471 (design pass D): the list had reached fourteen sections and ~35
// controls, and the ones a *user of a VPN app* changes were interleaved with
// the ones a *server admin or a developer* tunes — a start timeout above a
// language picker, a codec batch size above "Check for updates". One rule
// decides where a control lives now: if changing it is part of USING the app it
// is on this list; if it is tuning, it is behind the single "Advanced" push
// (`SettingsAdvancedView`, below). Six sections, ordered by how often they are
// touched:
//
//   Tunnel · When the app opens · Staying connected · Appearance · Updates · About
//
// Nothing was deleted from the app: every control that left this list is on
// Advanced, one tap away. What WAS deleted is dead machinery — the preset chip
// rows under the numeric fields (the defaults ARE the presets, and "Reset all
// settings" restores them) and the `ScrollViewReader` left behind by #470's
// font slider.
//
// #471 was: tunnelGroup · connectionGroup (start + stay-connected) ·
// networkGroup (SOCKS5 + DNS + vp8channel) · serversSection · checksGroup
// (IP check + speed test) · logsSection · appGroup (updates + appearance) ·
// infoSection — eight `@ViewBuilder` groups holding fourteen sections.
//
// Reads/writes go through SettingsStore.shared, which mirrors UserDefaults.
// SwiftUI rebinds on @Published changes automatically.
