// MARK: - App entry
//
// #457: hosts the root TabView with THREE tabs:
//   - Connect  — connection list, tunnel state, the one connect/disconnect action
//   - Servers  — SSH-managed hosts: install / uninstall / reboot olcrtc
//   - Settings — tunnel mode, SOCKS, DNS, appearance, diagnostics & logs
//
// #457 was: five tabs. Config held one 2-option picker plus one toggle while
// nine sibling settings lived in Settings — it is now `SettingsView.tunnelSection`
// (see ConfigView.swift). Logs needed a purpose-built pub/sub channel
// (`LogsRouter` + `onChange { selectedTab = 3 }` + `fetchingHostID`) just to be
// entered with the right context, which is the clearest possible proof it was a
// sub-view — it is now pushed with a `LogSubject` (see LogsView.swift). HIG Tab
// bars: "it's generally easier to navigate among fewer tabs."
//
// All @StateObject stores live on MainTabView so they survive tab switches
// and the tunnel can keep running while the user navigates around.
// SettingsStore is the only singleton (state shared between SwiftUI views
// and non-view callers like SOCKSSession), so it's referenced as .shared
// rather than @StateObject.
