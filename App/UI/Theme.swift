import UIKit  // #340: UIColor trait closures back the dynamic light/dark tokens

// #258: Design-system tokens — the single source of truth for color, spacing,
// shape, and type. App/UI/DesignSystem.swift and (later) every screen read from
// here instead of hardcoding `.controlSize(...)`, ad-hoc hex, or per-call tints.
//
// Values come from design_handoff_ui_redesign (pure-black ground, soft
// borderless cards). Where the handoff's hex matches an iOS system color we use
// the *semantic* color — noted per token — so Dynamic Type, contrast, and the
// dark palette keep working.
// #340 was: "The app is dark-only; this palette is authored for the dark
// appearance" — light values come from design_handoff_logs_theme §4; the
// appearance now follows SettingsStore.appearanceMode via preferredColorScheme
// in App.swift. Semantic system colors adapt for free; the handful of
// hardcoded grounds are dynamic via UIColor traits.
// #299 was: a runtime Refined/Console "design direction" (#267/#281) that only
// changed radii/borders/fonts, never colours. Dropped; the metric/type tokens
// are single (Refined) values.
// #456 was: a fourth *colour* scheme — Gray (#299) — alongside System/Light/Dark,
// whose grounds resolved to neutral mid-gray. Removed: a fourth scheme diluted
// the palette (three different "dark" grounds to design against for zero user
// benefit) and, because Dark↔Gray produced no colorScheme trait change, it
// forced a full TabView rebuild in App.swift just to refresh these tokens.
// Schemes are System / Light / Dark; the grounds are plain dark/light pairs
// resolved by the trait, and Light is now tuned to be genuinely good.
//
// #457: two inversions were fixed here.
//  (1) SCALE — the answer to the screen's one question used to render at
//      `statusTitle` (~15pt) inside a card carrying a 26pt coloured glow. The
//      glow is gone and `Typography.answer` exists so the ANSWER is the biggest
//      thing on screen. See the Typography block for the six-step scale.
//  (2) SEMANTICS — status was carried by colour alone. `OlcStatusTone` now
//      ships an SF Symbol per tone (DesignSystem.swift) so every state reads as
//      glyph + word + colour; the palette below only has to make the colour the
//      THIRD channel, not the only one.
// Also: every status hue now carries a deliberate LIGHT value. The system
// hues (`.green`/`.orange`/`.red`) are tuned for a dark ground and measure
// 2–3:1 as text on #F2F2F7 — unreadable exactly where the truth lives.
