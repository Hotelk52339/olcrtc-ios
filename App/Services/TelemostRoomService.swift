//
// One button's worth of API: create a fresh Telemost conference from the phone.
//
// Why the phone and not the VPS
// -----------------------------
// A Telemost link "works for 24 hours" and a server sitting in the room does not
// extend it. If the VPS rotated its own room, the phone could never learn the
// new id — during a whitelist window the only channel to the phone is the
// tunnel, which just died with the old room. So the phone mints the room and
// pushes the id down the (still usable) SSH path; see SSHTransport (#462).
//
// The request
// -----------
// Creating a room is ONE authenticated POST to the FREE "front" API the Telemost
// web client itself calls — not the paid business API at
// `cloud-api.yandex.net/v1/telemost-api/`, which 403s without a Yandex 360 for
// Business subscription. The whole credential is the `Session_id` cookie of an
// ordinary personal account; there is no CSRF token and nothing is signed.
// Joining stays anonymous (our own core joins with no cookie —
// `olcrtc-upstream/internal/auth/telemost/api.go`), so nothing about the tunnel
// changes.
//
// The header set below is NOT invented: it is the one our own Go core already
// sends to this same host and base URL (`connectionInfo` in that file), plus the
// `Cookie` the create call additionally needs. Keeping the two identical means a
// future header change is found in one obvious place.
//
// Isolation: a nonisolated `enum` of statics, like every other stateless service
// here (SubscriptionFetcher, NetPing, PortAvailability). Log lines hop to
// MainActor one at a time.
