// #465: WHEN to replace a Telemost room, and at what cost to the user.
//
// A Telemost link stops working 24 h after it is created — a clock, not an
// idle timer, so a server sitting in the room does not extend it. When the room
// dies the tunnel dies with it, and the tunnel is the ONLY road left to the VPS
// during a whitelist window: SSH rides inside it (App/Core/SSHTransport.swift),
// so losing the room means losing administrative access with no way back in.
// Renewing the room by hand requires noticing in time, which is exactly what
// nobody does.
//
// So the app renews on its own. The cost is that applying a new room restarts
// the container, which drops the connection for a few seconds — the whole point
// of this file is to spend that cost where the user cannot feel it:
//
//   * riding a DIFFERENT protocol → free, renew immediately;
//   * another protocol available  → move there first, then renew;
//   * riding this one, but idle   → a drop nobody is using costs nothing;
//   * riding this one, in use     → wait, and warn only once time runs short.
//
// The last rule is self-consistent: "in use" means the user is at the phone
// right now, which is exactly when a warning gets seen. An idle tunnel means
// nobody is watching — and nobody notices the blip either.
//
// Pure and synchronous on purpose: every branch here is a unit test
// (Tests/TelemostRenewalPolicyTests.swift). The side-effecting half lives in
// TelemostRenewalCoordinator.
