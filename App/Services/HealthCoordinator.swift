// MARK: - HealthCoordinator (#456)
//
// #456: the ONE owner of verified-health evidence. Nothing else in the app is
// allowed to run a health probe, and nothing else writes `NodeHealth`.
//
// WHY A SINGLETON (a deliberate deviation from CLAUDE.md's "app-wide stores are
// @StateObject on MainTabView, passed by initializer"):
//   • it is read by views on TWO tabs (Manage VPS + Connections) AND written by
//     NON-view code (`TunnelManager`, from `runEngine` and the keep-alive loop),
//     so there is no single view that could own it;
//   • threading it through four initializers would couple every screen to one
//     memberwise-init argument order — the exact class of bug that has broken
//     CI in this repo before.
// It follows the existing precedent of `SettingsStore.shared` and
// `LogStore.shared`: views observe it with
// `@ObservedObject private var health = HealthCoordinator.shared`.
//
// PROBE DISCIPLINE (all of it deliberate, none of it decoration):
//   • STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL — one shared chain (`tail`). The Go side has real
//     shared-state races (providerToken pinning on the shared runtime defaults,
//     ephemeral-port TOCTOU) and `pingGroup`'s own comment forbids parallel
//     native clients.
//   • DEBOUNCED — `shouldProbe` refuses a re-probe inside `minRecheckSeconds`
//     unless the user forced it.
//   • STALENESS-DRIVEN — an automatic sweep only touches `.never`/`.stale`
//     nodes and is capped at `autoSweepMaxNodes`.
//   • NEVER the live room — reuses `TunnelManager.shouldSkipBatchPing` verbatim,
//     re-read on each probe (two peers sharing one identity in a carrier room
//     break each other).
//   • REFUSES to run under a live system VPN — a probe's carrier signalling
//     would ride the very tunnel it is trying to measure while its ICE
//     candidates deliberately exclude utun, so every node would read dead. That
//     is `.inconclusive(.vpnActive)`, an honest "couldn't check".
//   • OWN 20 s BUDGET — never the user's 60 s start timeout, so a hung carrier
//     costs 20 s, not a minute per node.
//
// Nothing here runs at app launch and nothing runs automatically on the
// Connections tab: each probe is a real conference join on a third-party
// service costing ~5–15 s, cellular data and CPU. Persistence + a visible age
// answer "what worked recently" at launch for free.
